In no particular order, the following locations are known to have judge 
portraits. Some may be subject to copyright restriction. If so, I've made notes
to that effect.


Federal Judicial Center
-----------------------
The Federal Judicial Center (FJC) has a page with biographies and images here:

 - http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/judges.html
 
That shows biographies for a lot of federal judges and some of the biographies
have images. 

I found some sort of file server here, where you can identify the images and 
some meta data about them:

 - http://www.fjc.gov/history/portrait.nsf/lookup!OpenView&Start=1
 
To get these files, would probably require a fair amount of manual labor or a 
custom scraper, but there are about 200 that can be acquired.


Philadelphia Courts
-------------------
The Philadelphia Courts have undertaken the collection of portraits and 
biographical information on their site:

 - http://www.courts.phila.gov/portraits/intro.asp
 
By browsing around, you can find another few hundred images, but the copyright
on these is not clear as these are not works of the Federal Government. We are 
looking into getting these images directly from the source with permission to 
use and re-use them.

Note also that there are individual webpages that are easy to scrape: 

 - http://www.courts.phila.gov/portraits/bio.asp?P=9&keepThis=true&


Ramsey County Law Library Blog
------------------------------
This blog regularly posts portraits of judges from Minnesota that they have in
their collection at the library:

 - http://ramseylawlibrary.org/?category_name=judicial-portraits
 
This would net about 30-40 portraits, but it may be worth contacting the 
library to see if they have more.

Copyright on these images is not clear. We will need to get permission to use 
these.


Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims Bar Association
-----------------------------------------------------
These seven portraits might have been commissioned by the bar association or by
the court:

 - http://www.cavcbar.net/html/photo_gallery.html
 
If by the court, then they're federal works and fair game. If not, then we need
to reach out to the bar association and see if they can share these with us.

There's currently a contact email address on the page:

 - cavcbarassoc@cavcbar.net
 

David Wells Roth
----------------
This guy is a pro painter that makes portraits and posts them on his site. He 
has a bunch for Puerto Rico, which he says they solicited him for. I get the 
sense that these are fair game since they were made for the Puerto Rico federal
court:

 - http://davidwellsroth.com/portraits.html
 
Still: Probably a good idea to get in touch with him about the photos. There are
about 40 photos here.


Pioneer Courthouse Galleries
----------------------------
There is a collection of 10 9th Circuit Judges here:

 - http://pioneercourthouse.org/gallery-judges-portraits.html
 
These appear to be fair game, as this a federal court's website.


Portrait Presentations in the Supreme Court of North Carolina
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are about 10 modern portraits here:

 - http://nccourts.org/Courts/Appellate/Supreme/Portrait/Default.asp
 
These are likely to have copyright restrictions.



Texas Jurists Collection at the Tarlton Law Library
---------------------------------------------------
This is a collection of about 400 judges, attorneys general and legal scholars: 

 - https://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlaw/00018/law-00018.html
 
It appears it has not been digitized online, however I believe it is available
by reaching out to the library as I have seen some of the digital versions in 
other places.


Tarlton Law Library
-------------------
A collection of 160 judge portraits can be found:

 - http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/justices/profile/portrait/160
 
Usage of these images may be challenging as different ones have different usage
statements. However, the library as a whole has a CC Attribution License.


Federal Circuit Historical Society
